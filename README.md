## üßÆ Calculator Details

### Inflation Calculator
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate how inflation reduces purchasing power over time
- **Inputs**: Current amount, inflation rate, number of years
- **Outputs**: Future nominal value, real purchasing power, purchasing power lost
- **Visualization**: Area chart showing purchasing power erosion
- **Key Lesson**: Early planning and inflation-beating investments protect wealth

### Compound Interest Calculator
- **Purpose**: Show the power of compound growth and regular investing
- **Features**: Multiple compounding frequencies, additional deposit options
- **Advanced Formula**: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) + additional deposits
- **Visualization**: Growth chart separating principal from interest
- **Key Lesson**: Time and consistency are the most powerful wealth-building tools

### Time Value of Money Calculator
- **Purpose**: Solve for any variable in time value of money equations
- **Advanced Features**: Newton-Raphson methods for complex calculations
- **Variables**: Present value, future value, payment, periods, interest rate
- **Flexibility**: Calculate any unknown given the other variables
- **Key Lesson**: A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow

### Credit Card Payoff Calculator
- **Purpose**: Reveal the true cost of credit card debt
- **Payment Options**: Minimum payment (Interest + 1% of balance) or fixed amount
- **Outputs**: Payoff time, total interest, payment schedule
- **Visualizations**: Principal vs. interest charts, detailed payment tables
- **Key Lesson**: Minimum payments keep you in debt; pay more to save thousands

### Auto Loan Calculator
- **Purpose**: Calculate vehicle financing costs and schedules
- **Inputs**: Loan amount, interest rate, loan term
- **Outputs**: Monthly payment, total interest, complete amortization schedule
- **Features**: Full payment breakdown, year-by-year summary
- **Key Lesson**: Longer terms mean lower payments but much higher total costs

### Mortgage Calculator
- **Purpose**: Understand home loan payments and long-term costs
- **Features**: Monthly payment calculation, complete amortization schedule
- **Outputs**: Payment amount, total interest over life of loan
- **Visualization**: Year-by-year payment breakdown
- **Key Lesson**: Your largest purchase requires the most careful planning

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Framework & Libraries
- **React 19** - Modern UI framework with concurrent features
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development and better code reliability
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first CSS framework with custom theme
- **shadcn/ui** - High-quality, accessible component library
- **Recharts** - Responsive chart library for data visualization
- **Phosphor Icons** - Beautiful icon set for UI elements

### Key Technologies
- **GitHub Spark Runtime** - Integrated development platform
- **useKV Hook** - Persistent data storage across sessions
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations and transitions
- **React Hook Form** - Efficient form handling and validation

### Data Persistence
The application uses the GitHub Spark `useKV` hook for persistent storage:
```typescript
const [calculatorInputs, setCalculatorInputs] = useKV("calculator-data", defaultValues)
```

### Mathematical Accuracy
All calculations use industry-standard financial formulas:
- **Compound Interest**: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
- **Present Value**: PV = FV / (1 + r)^n
- **Payment Calculation**: PMT = PV √ó [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n-1]
- **Newton-Raphson**: For solving complex equations iteratively

## üé® Design System

### Color Palette
The application uses an educational institution theme with professional, accessible colors:

- **Primary**: Deep Academic Navy `oklch(0.35 0.095 230)`
- **Secondary**: Sophisticated Light Gray `oklch(0.88 0.015 220)`
- **Accent**: Distinguished Blue `oklch(0.58 0.12 200)`
- **Success**: Academic Green `oklch(0.62 0.15 140)`
- **Warning**: Professional Orange `oklch(0.68 0.13 45)`

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Inter - chosen for excellent readability and professional appearance
- **Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headers, body text, and numerical data
- **Tabular Figures**: Consistent number alignment in calculations

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Six-column tab layout with full feature access
