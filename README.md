## Deployment Guide

### GitHub Pages Deployment

1. **Prepare the repository**:
   - Ensure your project is in a GitHub repository
   - Make sure all changes are committed and pushed

2. **Configure Vite for GitHub Pages**:
   Create or update `vite.config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
   import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
   import path from 'path'

   export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [react()],
     base: '/your-repository-name/',
     resolve: {
       alias: {
         '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
       },
     },
     build: {
       outDir: 'dist',
       sourcemap: false,
     },
   })
   ```

3. **Set up GitHub Actions workflow**:
   Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
   ```yaml
   name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ main ]

   jobs:
     build-and-deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
