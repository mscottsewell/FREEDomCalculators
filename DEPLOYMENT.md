# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide
## Financial FREEDom Calculators - Spark Project

This comprehensive guide will walk you through deploying the Financial FREEDom Calculators (a GitHub Spark project) to GitHub Pages, making it accessible to students and educators worldwide.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your local machine
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Basic familiarity with command line/terminal

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Spark Project Considerations

This is a **GitHub Spark project**, which means it has special dependencies and configurations that differ from standard Vite/React projects. Follow these instructions carefully to ensure proper deployment.

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

1. **Create a new PUBLIC repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and click "New repository"
   - Name it something descriptive like `financial-calculators` or `sewell-financial-tools`
   - **MUST be Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - **Don't** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we'll add our own)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Get your project files ready:**
   - Ensure all your Spark project files are in a local folder
   - Verify that the `FHU_COB.jpg` image is in `src/assets/images/`
   - Confirm all calculator components are present

### Step 2: Configure the Project for Deployment

1. **Install GitHub Pages deployment tool:**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   ```

2. **Update package.json** (add/modify these sections):
   ```json
   {
     "name": "financial-freedom-calculators",
     "homepage": "https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME",
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "vite",
       "build": "tsc -b --noCheck && vite build",
       "preview": "vite preview",
       "predeploy": "npm run build",
       "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
     }
   }
   ```
   
   **‚ö†Ô∏è Replace:**
   - `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username
   - `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your repository name

3. **Create a production-ready vite.config.ts:**
   
   **IMPORTANT:** This replaces your existing vite.config.ts for deployment:
   
   ```typescript
   import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";
   import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react-swc";
   import { defineConfig } from "vite";
   import { resolve } from 'path';

   // Production config for GitHub Pages deployment
   export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [
       react(),
       tailwindcss(),
     ],
     base: '/YOUR_REPO_NAME/', // CRITICAL: Replace with your repo name
     resolve: {
       alias: {
         '@': resolve(import.meta.dirname, 'src')
       }
     },
     build: {
       outDir: 'dist',
       assetsDir: 'assets',
       sourcemap: false,
       minify: 'terser',
       rollupOptions: {
         output: {
           manualChunks: {
             vendor: ['react', 'react-dom'],
             charts: ['recharts', 'd3']
           }
         }
       }
     }
   });
   ```

### Step 3: Prepare Spark-Specific Adjustments

Since this is a Spark project, we need to handle the special Spark dependencies:

1. **Create a deployment-specific package.json** that removes Spark-specific dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Create a backup of your original package.json
   cp package.json package.json.spark-backup
   ```

2. **Update dependencies for deployment:**
   Remove these Spark-specific packages from dependencies (they won't work in GitHub Pages):
   - `@github/spark`
   - Any Spark-related plugins

3. **Create a simplified version of components** that don't use Spark-specific APIs:
   - Replace `useKV` with `localStorage` for deployment
   - Remove any `spark.llm` or other Spark API calls

### Step 4: Create a Deployment-Ready Version

1. **Create a deployment branch setup:**
   ```bash
   # Initialize git repository (if not already done)
   git init
   git branch -M main
   
   # Add your GitHub repository as origin
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   ```

2. **Test the build process:**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Test build locally
   npm run build
   
   # Preview the built version
   npm run preview
   ```
   
   Visit the preview URL and verify:
   - ‚úÖ All calculators load and function correctly
   - ‚úÖ Charts and visualizations appear properly
   - ‚úÖ FHU logo displays correctly
   - ‚úÖ Responsive design works on different screen sizes
   - ‚úÖ All calculations produce correct results

### Step 5: Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. **Commit and push your code:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Financial FREEDom Calculators for deployment"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   
   This command will:
   - Build your project (`npm run build`)
   - Create a `gh-pages` branch
   - Upload the `dist` folder contents to that branch
   - Push to GitHub

3. **Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Scroll to "Pages" section in the left sidebar
   - Under "Source": Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Under "Branch": Choose `gh-pages` and `/ (root)`
   - Click "Save"

### Step 6: Verify Deployment

After 5-10 minutes, your site should be live at:
`https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/`

**Check that everything works:**
- [ ] Site loads without errors
- [ ] All 6 calculator tabs are accessible
- [ ] FHU logo displays correctly
- [ ] Charts render properly
- [ ] Calculations work accurately
- [ ] Data persists between page refreshes
- [ ] Mobile/responsive design functions
- [ ] All styling appears correctly

## üîß Alternative Deployment Methods (Advanced)

### Method 1: GitHub Actions with Spark Adaptations

**Note:** This method requires additional configuration to handle Spark-specific dependencies.

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy Financial Calculators to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Build for production
      run: npm run build
      env:
        NODE_ENV: production
    
    - name: Setup Pages
      uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
    
    - name: Upload artifact
      uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
      with:
        path: './dist'
    
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      id: deployment
      uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### Method 2: Manual Build and Upload

For non-technical users who prefer uploading files:

1. **Build the project locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   
   This creates a `dist` folder with all the files needed for deployment.

2. **Upload to GitHub Pages manually:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Switch to the `gh-pages` branch (create it if it doesn't exist)
   - Delete all existing files in the branch
   - Upload all files from your local `dist` folder to the root of the `gh-pages` branch
   - Commit the changes with a message like "Update calculators deployment"

3. **Enable GitHub Pages** (same as main method Step 6)

## ‚ö° Handling Spark-Specific Features

This project was originally built as a GitHub Spark, which includes special features that need adaptation for standard deployment:

### Data Persistence (useKV ‚Üí localStorage)

The original project uses Spark's `useKV` for data persistence. For GitHub Pages deployment, create a compatibility layer:

Create `src/hooks/useKVFallback.ts`:

```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function useKV<T>(key: string, defaultValue: T): [T, (value: T | ((current: T) => T)) => void, () => void] {
  const [value, setValue] = useState<T>(() => {
    try {
      const stored = localStorage.getItem(key);
      return stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : defaultValue;
    } catch {
      return defaultValue;
    }
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    try {
      localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
    } catch (error) {
      console.warn('Failed to save to localStorage:', error);
    }
  }, [key, value]);

  const updateValue = (newValue: T | ((current: T) => T)) => {
    setValue(current => {
      const result = typeof newValue === 'function' 
        ? (newValue as (current: T) => T)(current)
        : newValue;
      return result;
    });
  };

  const deleteValue = () => {
    try {
      localStorage.removeItem(key);
      setValue(defaultValue);
    } catch (error) {
      console.warn('Failed to remove from localStorage:', error);
    }
  };

  return [value, updateValue, deleteValue];
}
```

Then replace all imports in your calculator components:
```typescript
// Replace this:
import { useKV } from '@github/spark/hooks'

// With this:
import { useKV } from '@/hooks/useKVFallback'
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Details & Troubleshooting

### Critical Configuration Files

#### 1. `vite.config.ts` (Production Version)
```typescript
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react-swc";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { resolve } from 'path';

  plugins: [
    react(),
    tailwindcss(),
  ],
  base: '/YOUR_REPO_NAME/', // MUST match your GitHub repository name
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': resolve(import.meta.dirname, 'src')
    }
  },
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist',
    assetsDir: 'assets',
    sourcemap: false,
    minify: 'terser'
  }
});
```

#### 2. `package.json` Updates
```json
{
  "homepage": "https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME",
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
  }
}
```

#### 3. Asset Import Verification
All assets MUST use import statements (not string paths):
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT
import logo from '@/assets/images/FHU_COB.jpg'
<img src={logo} alt="Logo" />

// ‚ùå WRONG - Will break on GitHub Pages
<img src="/src/assets/images/FHU_COB.jpg" alt="Logo" />
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Blank White Page
**Symptoms:** Site loads but shows only a blank page
**Cause:** Incorrect `base` path in vite.config.ts
**Solution:** 
```typescript
// In vite.config.ts, ensure base matches your repo name EXACTLY
base: '/financial-calculators/', // Must include leading and trailing slashes
```

#### Issue 2: 404 Errors for Assets
**Symptoms:** Images, fonts, or other assets not loading
**Solutions:**
1. Verify all assets use import statements
2. Check that `FHU_COB.jpg` exists in `src/assets/images/`
3. Rebuild and redeploy:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run deploy
   ```

#### Issue 3: JavaScript/React Errors
**Symptoms:** Console errors, broken functionality
**Solutions:**
1. Check for Spark-specific code that needs adaptation
2. Ensure all dependencies are compatible with standard React
3. Test locally first:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

#### Issue 4: Calculator Data Not Persisting
**Symptoms:** Input values don't save between page refreshes
**Solution:** Implement localStorage fallback (see Spark adaptations above)

#### Issue 5: Deploy Command Fails
**Solutions:**
```bash
# Clean reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Try deploying again
npm run deploy

# If still failing, check for build errors:
npm run build
```

### Verification Checklist
